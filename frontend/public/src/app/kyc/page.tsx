        To ensure a safe and compliant trading environment, all users must

        <h2>Why is KYC Important?</h2>
        <p>
          KYC verification is essential for confirming the identity of users and
          mitigating risks such as fraud, money laundering, and other financial
          crimes. It ensures that our trading environment remains secure and
          trustworthy.

        <h2>Our KYC Process - Step by Step</h2>
        <ol className={styles.stepsList}>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 1: Account Registration</strong>
            <p>
              Start by creating your account with basic details such as your
              full name, email address, and phone number.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 2: Document Upload</strong>
            <p>
              Upload a clear photo of a government-issued photo ID (passport,
              driverâ€™s license, or national ID). Make sure that all details are
              legible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 3: Selfie Verification</strong>
            <p>
              Take a selfie or record a short video as instructed. This step
              helps us verify that you are the same person in your photo ID.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 4: Address Verification (if required)</strong>
            <p>
              In some cases, we may ask for proof of address (such as a recent
              utility bill) to further confirm your identity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Step 5: Review & Approval</strong>
            <p>
              Our verification team will review your submissions. Once approved,
              you will receive a confirmation email, and your account will be
              marked as verified.
