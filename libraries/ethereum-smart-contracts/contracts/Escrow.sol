/**
 * @title Escrow
 * @notice A robust escrow contract for a crypto trading platform.
 *
 * This contract is deployed only once and reused for each trade. For each new trade,
 * the owner initializes trade-specific parameters via initTrade(), dynamically setting:
 *   - Buyer, Seller, and arbitrator addresses.
 *   - Trade amounts (cryptoAmount, buyerCollateral, and sellerCollateral).
 *   - Duration parameters (deposit duration, confirmation duration, dispute timeout).
 *   - Fee parameters (fee rate in basis points, platform wallet, and an additional profitMargin).
 *
 * In this design:
 *  - The seller must deposit: cryptoAmount + sellerCollateral + feeTotal,
 *    where feeTotal = (cryptoAmount * feeRate/10000) + profitMargin.
 *  - The buyer deposits buyerCollateral.
 *
 * Upon a successful trade release:
 *  - The buyer receives their full collateral back, plus the full cryptoAmount.
 *    (Thus, their balance increases by exactly cryptoAmount.)
 *  - The platform receives feeTotal.
 *  - The seller receives only their sellerCollateral.
 *
 * This means that the seller effectively pays the trade value plus fees, and the buyerâ€™s net gain is the full trade amount.
